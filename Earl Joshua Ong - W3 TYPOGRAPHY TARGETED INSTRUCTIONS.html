<h1>Goldilocks and the Three Bears</h1>

Once upon a time there were <b><font color="purple">three bears</font></b>, who lived together in a <font color="green"><u>house</u></font>
of their own in a <font color="green"><u>wood</u></font>. One of them was a <b><font color="purple">little, small wee bear</font></b>; one
was a <b><font color="purple">middle-sized bear</font></b>, and the other was a <b><font color="purple">great, huge bear.</font></b>

One day, after they had made porridge for their breakfast, they walked
out into the <font color="green"><u>wood</u></font> while the porridge was cooling. And while they were
walking, a <b><font color="purple">little girl</font></b> came into the <font color="green"><u>house</u></font>. This <b><font color="purple">little girl</font></b> had golden
curls that tumbled down her back to her waist, and everyone called her
by <b><font color="purple">Goldilocks.</font></b>

<b><font color="purple">Goldilocks</font></b> went inside. <font color="red"><sup>First she tasted the porridge of the</sup> <b><font color="purple">great, huge
bear,</font></b><sup> and that was far too hot for her. And then she tasted the porridge
of the</sup> <b><font color="purple">middle bear,</font></b><sup> and that was too cold for her.</sup></font> <font color="blue"><sub>And then she went to
the porridge of the </sub><b><font color="purple">little, small wee bear,</font></b> <sub>and tasted that. And that
was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right; and she liked it so
well, that she ate it all up.</sub></font>

Then <b><font color="purple">Goldilocks</font></b> went upstairs into the <font color="green"><u>bed chamber</u></font> <font color="red"><sup>and first she lay down
upon the bed of the</sup> <b><font color="purple">great, huge bear,</font></b> <sup>and then she lay down upon the bed
of the</sup> <b><font color="purple">middle bear</font></b> </font><font color="blue"><sub>and finally she lay down upon the bed of the</sub> <b><font color="purple">little,
small wee bear,</font></b> <sub> and that was just right. So she covered herself up
comfortably, and lay there until she fell fast asleep.</sub></font>

By this time, the <b><font color="purple">three bears</font></b> thought their porridge would be cool
enough, so they came home to breakfast.

<font color="#F9C70C"><i>“SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!” said the </i><b><font color="purple">great huge bear,</font></b> in his
great huge voice.</sup></font>

<font color="#F9C70C"><i>“Somebody has been at my porridge!” said the </i><b><font color="purple">middle bear,</font></b><i> in his middle
voice.</i></font>

<font color="#F9C70C"><i>Then the</i> <b><font color="purple">little, small wee bear</font></b> <i>looked at his, and there was the spoon
in the porridge pot, but the porridge was all gone.</i></font>

<font color="#F9C70C"><i>“Somebody has been at my porridge, and has eaten it all up!” said the</i>
<b><font color="purple">little, small wee bear,</font></b> <i>in his little, small wee voice.</i></font>

Then the <b><font color="purple">three bears</font></b> went upstairs into their <font color="green"><u>bedroom</u></font>

<font color="#F9C70C"><i>“SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!” said the</i> <b><font color="purple">great, huge bear,</font></b><i>in his
great, rough, gruff voice.</i></font>

<font color="#F9C70C"><i>“Somebody has been lying in my bed!” said the</i> <b><font color="purple">middle bear</font></b>, in his middle
voice.</i></font>

<font color="#F9C70C"><i>And when the</i> <b><font color="purple">little, small, wee bear</font></b><i> came to look at his bed, upon the
pillow there was a pool of golden curls, and the angelic face of a</i> <b><font color="purple">little
girl</font></b> <i>snoring away, fast asleep.</i></font>

<font color="blue"><sub>“Somebody has been lying in my bed, and here she is!” Said the</sub> <b><font color="purple">little,
small wee bear,</font></b> <sub>in his little, small wee voice.</sub>

<b><font color="purple">Goldilocks</font></b> <sub>jumped off the bed and ran downstairs, out of the door and
down the </sub><font color="green"><u>garden path.</u></font> <sub>She ran and she ran until she reached the </sub><font color="green"><u>house</u></font>
<sub>of her</sub> <b><font color="purple">grandmama.</font></b> <sub>When she told her</sub> <b><font color="purple">grandmama</font></b> <sub>about the house of the</sub>
<b><font color="purple">three bears</font></b> <sub>who lived in the wood, her</sub> <b><font color="purple">granny</font></b><sub> said: “My my, what a wild 
imagination you have, child!"</sub></font>
